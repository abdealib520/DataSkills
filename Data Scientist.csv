Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We expect you to have the ability to work independently on projects end-to-end starting with formulating problem statements, identifying solutions to the problems, breaking the solution into smaller tasks, and do hands on analysis of data to arrive at the solution

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?

Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?

Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?

Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?

Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?
