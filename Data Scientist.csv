Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We expect you to have the ability to work independently on projects end-to-end starting with formulating problem statements, identifying solutions to the problems, breaking the solution into smaller tasks, and do hands on analysis of data to arrive at the solution

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?

· Can you understand your problem well enough that you can convey the key message to a lay person through presentations and other means?

We are at the core, an analytics company, founded by people who, about 30 years ago, were pioneers in applying predictive modelling to solve business problems. As we morphed into a financial services company from being an analytics consultant, we continued to train our scientists to apply these techniques, as well as cutting-edge advances, and become a transformative leader in credit underwriting in the UK.

Job Title: Team Lead –Analytics and Data Science

Department: Analytics and Data Science (ADS)

Location: Chennai, Bangalore & Noida preferred, but we will consider any location for the right candidate

Collaborative teams: Organization-wide

Oh, the things you’ll do (role and responsibilities):

We predict credit risk and other key metrics using machine learning (ML) models – this will be one of your key tasks, where you will build these and work with stakeholders to implement them in a timely and accurate manner

You will also work on other underwriting rules and optimize them

Once these are implemented, you will help monitor the portfolio and suggest corrections where necessary

You will evaluate other data sources to improve these models

We do not just work on underwriting – the team provides analytics support across the organization, and you will be involved in this work

You will run controlled tests based on Design of Experiments principle to add value to the business – this involves critical thinking

You will mentor junior members and help them grow

What you need to bring to the table (experience and qualifications):

· You should have built machine learning models and have good knowledge of statistics

· You should have good understanding of the underlying details about how the machine learning models work

· We need someone who has programmed before – in R or Python or SQL etc. If you can program well in any language, we feel you can pick up another easily.

· Are you a critical thinker with good problem solving skills? We do not just build ML models using pre-packaged tools – that is a good skill to have but does not make you a rounded data scientist. In your job, you may just be asked a high level, poorly defined question – your job will involve understanding context, bounding the problem, forming hypotheses and delving into the data and coming up with a solution. Have you done that? Are you confident of doing that?

· Can you understand your problem well enough that you can convey the key message to a lay person through presentations and other means?

Delhivery,Senior Data Scientist (5-8yrs) - Gurgaon,"About the team

Data Science is an integral part of Delhivery. Given the scale of our operations (nearly two

million parcels delivered each day), it is imperative to use technology and algorithms in

everything we do, and the data science team is at the center of this.

The mandate for the team is to identify and solve high-impact business problems that can be

tackled with the large amounts of data that we collect. This includes, but is not limited to,

decisions on network optimization, package routing, address understanding and partner

intelligence.

The three major data science interventions that affect the lifecycle of every parcel are –

1. Understanding where the parcel is located (geocoding, NLP, advanced search algorithms)

2. Predicting time and distance estimates for various combinations of pickups and deliveries

(geospatial analysis, trajectory data, regression estimates, time series modelling)

3. Optimizing business objectives adjusting for real-world fuzzy constraints to make optimal

choices for parcel movement from pickup to the desired point of delivery (Operations Research,

Soft Computing, Meta Heuristics, Clustering, Simulations).

The above constitutes much of our work since the underlying data distribution, data size, data

velocity and business landscape keeps evolving for us to constantly improve them and

occasionally, completely challenge previous assumptions and build stuff from grounds-up.

About the role

We expect a person to be very strong in at least one of NLP or Operations Research or

Maps/Routing Algorithms to effectively deliver impact in one of the areas mentioned above.

Every person in the team is exposed to all the problems and with time, people are encouraged

to explore problems outside their core area of expertise.

At a senior level, you are expected to own a business problem. That involves ability to convert

business problems to a technical problem, come up with time and feasibility estimates,

technically guide a very small team of 1-3 people to develop the solution, do in-depth analysis of

results and effectively communicate with all stakeholders. It also involves picking up

experimental stuff which may be useful in near future without a need for a requirement from

other teams.

We are currently hybrid, and the role is based out of Gurgaon.

Required Qualifications

We are looking for people who are excited by data, and excited by business, and excited in

bringing the two together to create high impact. We are a fast-paced team, and expect quick

turnarounds.

Key requirements

● Strong mathematics and logic skills

● Strong written, oral and visual communication skills

● Strong in Python skills

● Deep knowledge of either operations research or statistics or machine learning or

natural language processing or simulations, and the ability to apply them to unstructured

industry problems

● A passion for data and analytics

● Common sense, and an appreciation of common logical fallacies

● Proven ability to deliver end-to-end solutions to industry problems

● 4+ years of relevant industry experience
