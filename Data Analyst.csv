2. ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND:

FIND was established in India as an independent non-profit created under Section 8 (Indian) Companies Act, 2013 with its office in New Delhi. The organization is dedicated to activities that result in: 1) new diagnostic tools; 2) expanded access to these tools; and 3) strengthened diagnostic testing capacity for poverty-related diseases. FIND has several projects in TB, Hepatitis C (HCV), COVID-19, Malaria, fever, and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

FIND is supporting the NTEP lab network through continued sustenance of service delivery and expansion of NTEP’s diagnostic capacity for Drug Resistant-TB through development of 20 new C-DST labs, operationalization of genome sequencing equipment, and scaling up of the LIMS to all C-DST labs.

One of the strategic pillars in the NTEP’s national strategic plan (NSP) is “Detect” which focuses on creating a comprehensive, high-quality TB diagnostic network to accurately and rapidly diagnose TB and link the patients with appropriate and timely treatment. The patient pathway analysis has highlighted the frequent disconnect between the availability and placement of diagnostic services and patient care-seeking behaviour. Network design that is better aligned with patient health-seeking behaviour is expected to help alleviate barriers to care and will assist governments and donors to improve the efficiency of investments and service delivery.

Under the project, FIND will work to scale up the diagnostic network optimization exercise to cover 10 large states across the country which contribute to a majority of the testing volumes.

FIND,Data Analyst,"1. POSITION VACANT: Data Analyst, FIND, Anywhere in India

2. ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND:

FIND was established in India as an independent non-profit created under Section 8 (Indian) Companies Act, 2013 with its office in New Delhi.

FIND has several projects in TB, Hepatitis C (HCV), COVID-19, Malaria, fever, and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

FIND is supporting the NTEP lab network through continued sustenance of service delivery and expansion of NTEP’s diagnostic capacity for Drug Resistant-TB through development of 20 new C-DST labs, operationalization of genome sequencing equipment, and scaling up of the LIMS to all C-DST labs.

One of the strategic pillars in the NTEP’s national strategic plan (NSP) is “Detect” which focuses on creating a comprehensive, high-quality TB diagnostic network to accurately and rapidly diagnose TB and link the patients with appropriate and timely treatment. The patient pathway analysis has highlighted the frequent disconnect between the availability and placement of diagnostic services and patient care-seeking behaviour. Network design that is better aligned with patient health-seeking behaviour is expected to help alleviate barriers to care and will assist governments and donors to improve the efficiency of investments and service delivery.

Under the project, FIND will work to scale up the diagnostic network optimization exercise to cover 10 large states across the country which contribute to a majority of the testing volumes. These include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Odisha, Telangana, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.

The key activities and outputs under the project will include:

1. Coordinating collection of data from the identified districts in the State related to the location of the Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT), TrueNat, their current capacity and utilisation, patient flow, and status of sample referral systems.

3. Estimate future demand for testing as upfront CBNAAT/NAAT is expanded to all newly diagnosed TB patients.

4. Map the location and capacity of TB diagnostic testing services in selected private sector labs and propose engagement models and referral patterns to optimize overall network efficiency and increase patient access to diagnosis.

5. Recommend the optimal sample referral network design from a health facility to a molecular testing site, plus on-referral for Culture (C)/Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)/Linear Probe Assay (LPA) using a multi-stop estimation method.

One of the strategic pillars in the NTEP’s national strategic plan (NSP) is “Detect” which focuses on creating a comprehensive, high-quality TB diagnostic network to accurately and rapidly diagnose TB and link the patients with appropriate and timely treatment. The patient pathway analysis has highlighted the frequent disconnect between the availability and placement of diagnostic services and patient care-seeking behaviour. Network design that is better aligned with patient health-seeking behaviour is expected to help alleviate barriers to care and will assist governments and donors to improve the efficiency of investments and service delivery.

Under the project, FIND will work to scale up the diagnostic network optimization exercise to cover 10 large states across the country which contribute to a majority of the testing volumes. These include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Odisha, Telangana, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.

The key activities and outputs under the project will include:

3. Estimate future demand for testing as upfront CBNAAT/NAAT is expanded to all newly diagnosed TB patients.

4. Map the location and capacity of TB diagnostic testing services in selected private sector labs and propose engagement models and referral patterns to optimize overall network efficiency and increase patient access to diagnosis.

5. Recommend the optimal sample referral network design from a health facility to a molecular testing site, plus on-referral for Culture (C)/Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)/Linear Probe Assay (LPA) using a multi-stop estimation method.

FIND is supporting the NTEP lab network through continued sustenance of service delivery and expansion of NTEP’s diagnostic capacity for Drug Resistant-TB through development of 20 new C-DST labs, operationalization of genome sequencing equipment, and scaling up of the LIMS to all C-DST labs.

One of the strategic pillars in the NTEP’s national strategic plan (NSP) is “Detect” which focuses on creating a comprehensive, high-quality TB diagnostic network to accurately and rapidly diagnose TB and link the patients with appropriate and timely treatment. The patient pathway analysis has highlighted the frequent disconnect between the availability and placement of diagnostic services and patient care-seeking behaviour. Network design that is better aligned with patient health-seeking behaviour is expected to help alleviate barriers to care and will assist governments and donors to improve the efficiency of investments and service delivery.

Under the project, FIND will work to scale up the diagnostic network optimization exercise to cover 10 large states across the country which contribute to a majority of the testing volumes. These include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Odisha, Telangana, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.

The key activities and outputs under the project will include:

1. Coordinating collection of data from the identified districts in the State related to the location of the Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT), TrueNat, their current capacity and utilisation, patient flow, and status of sample referral systems.

3. Estimate future demand for testing as upfront CBNAAT/NAAT is expanded to all newly diagnosed TB patients.

4. Map the location and capacity of TB diagnostic testing services in selected private sector labs and propose engagement models and referral patterns to optimize overall network efficiency and increase patient access to diagnosis.

5. Recommend the optimal sample referral network design from a health facility to a molecular testing site, plus on-referral for Culture (C)/Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)/Linear Probe Assay (LPA) using a multi-stop estimation method.

FIND is supporting the NTEP lab network through continued sustenance of service delivery and expansion of NTEP’s diagnostic capacity for Drug Resistant-TB through development of 20 new C-DST labs, operationalization of genome sequencing equipment, and scaling up of the LIMS to all C-DST labs.

One of the strategic pillars in the NTEP’s national strategic plan (NSP) is “Detect” which focuses on creating a comprehensive, high-quality TB diagnostic network to accurately and rapidly diagnose TB and link the patients with appropriate and timely treatment. The patient pathway analysis has highlighted the frequent disconnect between the availability and placement of diagnostic services and patient care-seeking behaviour. Network design that is better aligned with patient health-seeking behaviour is expected to help alleviate barriers to care and will assist governments and donors to improve the efficiency of investments and service delivery.

Under the project, FIND will work to scale up the diagnostic network optimization exercise to cover 10 large states across the country which contribute to a majority of the testing volumes. These include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Odisha, Telangana, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.

The key activities and outputs under the project will include:

1. Coordinating collection of data from the identified districts in the State related to the location of the Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT), TrueNat, their current capacity and utilisation, patient flow, and status of sample referral systems.

3. Estimate future demand for testing as upfront CBNAAT/NAAT is expanded to all newly diagnosed TB patients.

4. Map the location and capacity of TB diagnostic testing services in selected private sector labs and propose engagement models and referral patterns to optimize overall network efficiency and increase patient access to diagnosis.

5. Recommend the optimal sample referral network design from a health facility to a molecular testing site, plus on-referral for Culture (C)/Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)/Linear Probe Assay (LPA) using a multi-stop estimation method.
